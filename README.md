# Twilio SMS Message Forwarding - MERN Control App

This is a MERN full-stack app and API which controls the behaviour of a twilio function that forwards SMS messages received on a certain twilio mobile phone number to email. A setting on this app's interface controls whether the twilio function sends email only or both email and SMS.
